README: Influencer Performance Analysis Assignment
Overview
This repository contains all files and resources developed and used for the assignment "Influencer Performance Analysis." The task involves analyzing ~200 videos to identify unique influencers, extracting their faces, and calculating their performance metrics. The key deliverables include an HTML table, the core algorithm script, and the processed data file in CSV format.

Repository Structure
Algorithm File
Contains the Python script used for video processing, face detection, and influencer performance analysis. The code is designed to handle videos with or without faces effectively and outputs structured data for further use.

Processed Data File (.csv)
The final CSV file provides detailed metrics for each unique influencer, including:

Influencer ID
Average Performance
Number of Videos
Links to detected face images.
HTML Table File
The table provides an interactive summary of influencer details with image links for better evaluation.

Screenshot Images Doc
To address potential visibility issues in the HTML table due to local image paths, a Doc file with screenshots of the output table has been included. This ensures seamless evaluation without requiring any execution.

How to Evaluate
Review Algorithm: Understand the logic behind face detection and performance analysis from the script file.
Explore the CSV File: Gain insights into influencer metrics and details.
Check the HTML Table: Use the HTML file to visualize influencer performance interactively.
Refer to Screenshot Doc: For cases where images in the HTML table are not visible, use the Doc file with embedded screenshots for seamless evaluation.
Key Notes
The algorithm handles videos without faces by skipping them automatically.
All necessary files are prepared for a one-time analysis of the provided ~200 videos.
The repository also lays the foundation for future enhancements, such as continuous incremental analysis.
Thank you for your time and effort in evaluating this submission!
